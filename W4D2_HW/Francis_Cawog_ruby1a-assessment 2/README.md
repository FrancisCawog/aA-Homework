# Ruby 1a Assessment

**Do not share this repo or post it publicly. App Academy will take violations
very seriously.**

* You will have 45 minutes for this assessment.
* Don't worry if you can't pass every spec within the time limit; do the best
  you can.
* Run `bundle install` to set up.
  * If you have an error bundle installing, delete the __Gemfile.lock__ and try
    again.
* Instructions for each problem are included in __lib/a01.rb__. Write
  all of your code inside this file.
* Run the specs as you solve the assessment. Try to get as many specs to pass as
  you can.
  * To run all the specs, run `bundle exec rspec` from the assessment's root
    directory.
  * To run one particular spec, specify the file and add the `:<line_number>` of
    the desired spec at the end.  
    For example, `bundle exec rspec spec/a01_spec.rb:18`.
* Look at the title of a failing spec to see why it failed. You can also look at
  the spec code for more information.
* Your score is based on the number of passing specs. If you get stuck on a
  problem, move on to the next one. It is in your interest to tackle easier
  problems first.
* Please ask your Instructors any questions. If you get stuck or don't know why
  something is failing, ask. Instructors will let you know if they cannot answer
  your question, so ask anything.
* Do not use the internet or prior notes.
